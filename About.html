        <h2> How I started</h2>
        <p>I started my journey in IT back in 2019 through a college program called YearUP.
            Year up is somewhat of a college preparation course that helps young adults graduating highschool learn, adapt and train in prepartion to enter either the business or IT world
            While apart of the program, I enrolled into El centro community college (Now known as Dallas Community college) and was added to genearl courses such as English and math. YearUp participants took part in ellective like classes such as Business courses and professionalism courses.
            These courses generally went over a day in the life within Corporate America's world and taught us how to conduct ourselves as professionals.

            <h3> My life Before IT</h3>
            <p> Before my venturing into IT, I was a lost highschool graduate that was job searching and trying everything in hopes that something would stick or keep my interest.
                I've been a detailer, car salesman, car auction driver, stocking and warhouse labor.
                My first job was at UPS as a seasonal forklift driver. Although short lived, it was my first true job and the first time I had a stable income.
                    </p>
            <p> At one point during my 20's, I was working two jobs as a Warehouse Associate for Staffmark and a Stocker for Five below by night. I didn't need 2 jobs but I wanted to get the experience and understanding how working two jobs could affect the body. And I just enjoyed the extra money.
                Once that phase passed, I attempted to get into the welding field and enrolled into TSTC located in Red Oak, Texas. 
                This would be my life for a year until a bad accident left me concussed and I was failed due to 60% of the grading for the courses being attendance. With a concussion I was not allowed to go to class for 3 weeks due to being concussed. </p>
            </p>
            <p> December 2018 was a rough month in my life due to the unfortunate and unpredictable passing of a girlfriend of 8 months. 
                I also was informed by my college instructor I would have to repeat my welding class and was trapped trying to figure out how to pay for my student loans and a new car
                    </p>
                    <p> January 2019 I decided that I needed a changed and ventured into the IT field and never looked back</p>
